# Muon Electric Dipole Moment - Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for my Master's project on the Muon Electric Dipole Moment (EDM).

It is used for **version tracking** and maintaining a **log of work done** throughout the project.

Data files (.pkl) are stored locally in:

* `data/With EDM/`
* `data/Without EDM/`

These files are not included in the repository due to size, but can be found [here](https://hep.ph.liv.ac.uk/~jprice/Project2025-26/).
